This project was originally intended to be utilized in the summer research project I worked on at Stevens Institute of Technology regarding language processing. We decided to go with a different layout, so these templates were never utilized. I decided instead of letting them sit on my desktop, I would display them here. Included in the documents are authentication pages (login, signup, forgot password), student and teacher dashboards, open-ended and mcq-styled (multiple choice question) webpages, and alert pages. Below are the links to each page. All references to videos and sources I used are in the Design folder in the text file labeled "References."
